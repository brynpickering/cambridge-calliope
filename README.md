If you use this model or work derived from it in an academic publication, please cite the above paper.

## Install

This paper ran on a development version of Calliope 0.6.3. To install, download the `DMUU.yml` requirements file found in the `requirements` directory of this repository. Install it by using the Calliope development environment instructions:

```shell
$ conda env create -f DMUU.yml
```

## Running models

The notebook 'DMUU' will guide you through building the model.

## Notes

* Native Calliope plotting will not work in most cases, due to the existence of the 'scenario' dimension.
